# dotfiles
Dotfiles. I mostly use them on Archlinux but ideally they'll work on any distribution,
or at least systemd based ones. At the very least the literal dotfiles should be
mostly portable, although they may not work with older versions of programs.
I do not like the way it currently looks. (and I probably never will)

## Dependencies (approximate)
1. bash
2. st
    - alpha
    - anysize
    - bold-is-not-bright
    - boxdraw (the patch needs to be messed with to get it to work with alpha)
3. tmux
4. i3-gaps
5. dunst
6. neovim (symlink init.vim to .vimrc)
7. nnn
8. Thunar
9. firejail
10. alsa (amixer)
11. pulseaudio
12. rofi
