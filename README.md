# Arch-Dotfiles
Dotfiles for my Archlinux desktop/laptop. Very WIP. May not work.
I do not like the way it currently looks.

Rough list of dependencies:
polybar
powerline
powerline-fonts
vim
bash
i3-gaps
ttf-hack
ttf-ionicons
lesspipe
kitty (I'm going to change this sometime in the future; I don't like it very much)
alsa (amixer)
pulseaudio
dmenu
redshift

and all of their respective dependencies
