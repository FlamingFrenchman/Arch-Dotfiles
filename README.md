# Arch-Dotfiles
Dotfiles for my Archlinux desktop/laptop. Very WIP. May not work.
I do not like the way it currently looks. (and I probably never will)

## Dependencies (approximate)
1.  polybar
2.  neovim (I symlinked init.vim to .vimrc)
    - nnn.vim
    - coc.vim
3.  bash
4.  i3-gaps
5.  ttf-hack
6.  ttf-ionicons
7.  thunar
8.  firejail
9.  lesspipe
10. kitty (I'm going to change this sometime in the future; I don't like it very much)
11. alsa (amixer)
12. pulseaudio
13. rofi
14. redshift
15. nnn

There is an mpd module that I do not currently use.
