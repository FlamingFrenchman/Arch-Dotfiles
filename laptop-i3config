# Currently used keybinds:
# sup+h,j,k,l
# sup+shift+h,j,k,l
# sup+a,o,e,u,i
# sup+m
# sup+d
# sup+v
# sup+z
# sup+p
# sup+y
# sup+q
# sup+r
# sup+b
# sup+x
# sup+n
# sup+w
# sup+t
# sup+Return
#
# As a rule of thumb I should try to use shorthands (v for volume, b for
# browser, m for mute, etc.) when mapping keys so that they make sense
# regardless of layout. Currently it's about half and half, although
# the worst offenders (the vowels) aren't mapped to things I use frequently
# so I'm not sure it matters much.
#
# A lot of the keys are starting to get used so it may actually be useful
# to go back to a modal setup, kinda like the resize mode in the default
# config. rofi, window movement, terminal, changing workspace, and other common
# actions will still be in the default mode. All modes can be exited with at
# least one of $mod+q, $mod+Q q, Q
#
# Possible modes are:
# - Application ($sup+a): for launching things I commonly use, like firefox,
#   Thunar, VirtualBox, the terminal, etc. This mode should be exited after
#   launching a command, so it'll work kinda like a prefix.
# - Resize/Move (tbd): for changing up the window layout.
# - Volume/Sound/Brightness ($sup+v): muting, volume up/down, change output,
#   etc. Some commands, like mute and sink change, will have this mode work
#   as a prefix.
# - Status/Ping (tbd): checking the status of certain things, like internet
#   connectivity, battery, audio stuff, time? This might be something I should
#   put in the default mode but we'll see. I could also accomplish the same
#   thing by putting conky in a workspace somewhere.

# Font for window titles. Will also be used by the bar unless a different font is used in the bar {} block below.  font pango:Hack 15

# This font is widely installed, provides lots of unicode glyphs, right-to-left
# text rendering and scalability on retina/hidpi displays (thanks to pango).
#font pango:DejaVu Sans Mono 8

# Before i3 v4.8, we used to recommend this one as the default:
# font -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-120-75-75-C-70-iso10646-1
# The font above is very space-efficient, that is, it looks good, sharp and
# clear in small sizes. However, its unicode glyph coverage is limited, the old
# X core fonts rendering does not support right-to-left and this being a bitmap
# font, it doesn't scale on retina/hidpi displays.
